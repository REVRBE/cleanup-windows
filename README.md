### cleanup-windows

Project aimed at cleaning certain stuff on a Windows system.

## What it cleans so far:

* Iconcache
* Thumbcache

I've been working on a project which heavily relied on research upon evidence of process execution and other ways to find traces of a program. Therefore I won't release everything right away; and we'll start of with the Iconcache and Thumbcache.

I'll be updating this source and release methods to clean registry, prefetch and other Windows components and services.
